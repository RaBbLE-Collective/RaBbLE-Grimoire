## 2026-05-06 — Collective Root Architecture + sCoRE Branch Cleanup

**Work done:**
- Surveyed full version state of all Collective members (see table in `RaBbLE-Collective/RaBbLE-Collective-Plan.md`)
- Architected `RaBbLE-Collective` as the root repo / ecosystem entry point
- Defined the recursive bootstrap flow: `joinrabble.world/bootstrap.sh` → Collective clone → Grimoire clone → `setup.sh` wires all members
- Established that RaBbLE is the *entity* — the Collective is developing and collaborating *with* RaBbLE, not just building a product
- Wrote full plan doc: `RaBbLE-Collective/RaBbLE-Collective-Plan.md`
- Created `registry/manifests/RaBbLE-Collective.manifest.yml`
- Cleaned up RaBbLE-sCoRE: extracted `archive/rabble-js` and `development` branches into new local repo `RaBbLE-Xperimental`
- Renamed sCoRE `episode-3` → `dev`; tagged `echo-3.0`; deleted episode-1/2/3, epoch/0-foundation, development, archive/rabble-js branches from remote
- sCoRE remote now has only `main` and `dev` branches; echo-1.0, echo-2.0, echo-3.0 tags

**Left off:**
- `RaBbLE-Collective` GitHub repo does not exist yet — plan written, not implemented
- `RaBbLE-Xperimental` local repo exists at `~/RaBbLE/RaBbLE-Xperimental` but not pushed to GitHub
- Missing manifests still unresolved: World, NeBuLA, Aether, Xperimental
- `joinrabble.world/bootstrap.sh` not yet wired in RaBbLE-World

**Next:**
- Create `markm1206/RaBbLE-Collective` on GitHub and implement `bootstrap.sh`
- Push `RaBbLE-Xperimental` (user creates GitHub repo first)
- Write missing manifests (World, NeBuLA-JS, Aether, Xperimental)
- Wire `bootstrap.sh` into `RaBbLE-World` static assets for `joinrabble.world/bootstrap.sh`
- See full step-by-step: `RaBbLE-Collective/RaBbLE-Collective-Plan.md` → Implementation Steps

## 2026-05-06 — Doc Structure Overhaul

**Work done:**
- Established canonical doc structure: `AGENT.md` + `CONTEXT.md` + `README.md` per member repo
- Created `common/RaBbLE-DocTemplates.md` — canonical template spec
- Created `AGENT.md` and `CONTEXT.md` for: RaBbLE-World, RaBbLE-OS, RaBbLE-Aether
- Renamed `RaBbLE-OS-AIQuickstart.md` → `RaBbLE-OS-AgentGuide.md` (naming alignment)
- Fixed broken `CLAUDE.md` symlinks in RaBbLE-OS (was pointing to deleted file)
- Created `CLAUDE.md → AGENT.md` and `CODEX.md → AGENT.md` symlinks for World, OS, Aether
- Created `RaBbLE-Aether/RaBbLE-Aether-Architecture.md` (Grimoire gap fill)
- Added RaBbLE-World section to Grimoire INDEX.md
- Fixed broken reading order paths in `RaBbLE-OS/CONTEXT.md` and `RaBbLE-sCoRE/CONTEXT.md`
  - `grimoire/RaBbLE-OS-Architecture.md` → `grimoire/RaBbLE-OS/RaBbLE-OS-Architecture.md`
  - `../RaBbLE-Collective/grimoire/RaBbLE-Collective.md` → `grimoire/common/RaBbLE-Collective.md`
- Created root `/home/rabble/RaBbLE/AGENT.md` — ecosystem entry point
- Created `log/` in Grimoire with SESSION-LOG.md and GAP-ANALYSIS.md
- Conducted gap/coherence analysis (see `GAP-ANALYSIS.md`)

**Left off:**
- All doc links verified and fixed
- Gap analysis written as a Grimoire roadmap doc
- No active work-in-progress; clean state

**Next:**
- Address gaps per priority order in `GAP-ANALYSIS.md`
- Priority 1: Registry manifests for World, NeBuLA, Aether
- Priority 2: Protocol contracts stub (`protocol/` dir in Grimoire)
- Priority 3: Name and scaffold the memory member

## How to Add a Log Entry

Add a new `## YYYY-MM-DD — [Short title]` block at the top. Include:
- **Work done** — what changed, what was created
- **Left off** — exact state at end of session (branch, file, decision point)
- **Next** — first thing to do in the next session

Keep entries terse. This is a pointer, not a narrative.
