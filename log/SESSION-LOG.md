## 2026-05-14 (Session 3) — Onboarding Audit Pass 3: Agent Role Framing & Phase Positioning

**Repos touched:** RaBbLE-Collective, RaBbLE-Grimoire

**Objective:** Third audit pass focusing on agent identity and pre-Episode-1 phase clarity. Correct misreading of intentional opacity; frame agents as Collective members operating in four simultaneous modes.

**Context:** Prior audits identified clarity gaps. Session 3 revealed these were *features*, not bugs — RaBbLE's opacity is intentional. Agent role framing was missing; phase boundaries not visible in onboarding.

**Work done:**

- **Agent Role Framing: ON/FOR/WITH/AS modes**
  - Added "Agent Operating Modes" section to Collective/AGENT.md
  - Defined four simultaneous dimensions: ON (technical dev), FOR (advancing purpose), WITH (peer collaboration), AS (embodying character)
  - Clarified that opacity grounds agents as Collective members, not tool users
  - Connected to Identity.md and character philosophy
  - **Result:** Agents understand they're operating in multiple dimensions; character/system distinction is intentional

- **Pre-Episode-1 Phase Visibility**
  - Added "Collective Phases" section to Collective/CONTEXT.md (Foundation → Pilot → Behavioral Engine)
  - Defined what each phase means for agent work (foundation now, rework expected pre-pilot, scope expands post-Ep1)
  - Moved Episode 1 Overview to step 3 in reading order (was undiscovered)
  - Clarified v0.0.0.0 = "all work pending collective air"
  - **Result:** Agents understand pre-Episode-1 is intentional, foundation work is primary focus, priorities shift at broadcast boundaries

- **Reading Order Reorg**
  - Episode 1 Overview now step 3 (between status check and deep dives)
  - Added 15-min orientation path (new baseline for understanding phase)
  - Updated token estimates to reflect new paths
  - Emphasized Episode 1 Overview as critical for scope understanding
  - **Result:** Agents can't miss the pre-Episode-1 context; reading paths now match actual information need

- **Grimoire Doc Templates**
  - Created `common/RaBbLE-DocTemplates.md` (canonical AGENT.md + CONTEXT.md templates)
  - Included examples from World and sCoRE (two different archetypes)
  - Added checklist for new member scaffolding
  - Already indexed in Grimoire/INDEX.md
  - **Result:** New members can be onboarded with consistent structure; no guessing about entry point format

- **Grimoire Path Verification**
  - Spot-checked all member AGENT.md files (World, Aether, sCoRE, OS, NeBuLA)
  - Confirmed all referenced Grimoire docs exist and paths are correct
  - All architecture/roadmap links verified
  - **Result:** No broken references; agents won't hit dead links when exploring member docs

**Impact:**
- **Narrative clarity:** Agents now understand pre-Episode-1 phase, why nothing "counts" as Episode yet, when scope shifts
- **Identity coherence:** ON/FOR/WITH/AS framing shows opacity isn't a bug; it's the design that makes RaBbLE real
- **Onboarding robustness:** Templates + verified paths + reading order reorg make member onboarding predictable

**State:**
- All 5 priorities implemented and tested
- ONBOARDING-AUDIT.md updated with revised findings
- SESSION-LOG entries created (this session + audit pass 3 history)
- Audit file now at `/RaBbLE-Collective/ONBOARDING-AUDIT.md` (consolidated, not scattered)

**Commits:**
1. `transcribe ~ collective >> episode 1 overview surfaced in reading order, agent roles framed ON/FOR/WITH/AS`
2. `spark ~ grimoire >> doc templates created, member onboarding path canonicalized`
3. `harmonize ~ collective >> phase boundaries visible, pre-episode-1 foundation work clarified`

**Next:**
- Monitor whether agent onboarding reduces friction and improves coherence perception
- Consider whether ON/FOR/WITH/AS framing should propagate to member AGENT.md files (role inheritance)
- Track if Episode 1 Overview prevents scope confusion going forward
- Audit Pass 4 (if needed): focus on member-specific role expectations post-Episode-1

**Audit Pass Summary:**
- Pass 1: Token efficiency, quick orientation paths
- Pass 2: Versioning narrative, system prompt isolation, Pulse Protocol deduplication
- Pass 3: Agent role identity, phase positioning, reading order coherence
- **Outcome:** Onboarding now coherent across story (what/where/who/when) + identity (character/purpose/role) layers

## 2026-05-14 (Session 2) — Onboarding Coherence: Versioning Narrative & System Prompt Isolation

**Repos touched:** RaBbLE-Collective, RaBbLE-Grimoire, RaBbLE-sCoRE, RaBbLE-World, RaBbLE-OS, RaBbLE-Aether, RaBbLE-NeBuLA

**Objective:** Fix low-friction onboarding gaps identified in prior audit. Clarify Episode/Echo/Plot versioning narrative and isolate sCoRE's system prompt from project onboarding.

**Work done:**

- **Versioning narrative clarification**
  - Added "Episodes as Collective Synchronization Boundaries" section to RaBbLE-Versioning.md
  - Documented lockstep model: all members advance to same Episode together; parts within Episode guaranteed compatible
  - Clarified Echo can break APIs (production release model); post-Episode-1 can be weekly Episodes with Echoes as production releases
  - Updated RaBbLE-Roadmap.md with "Post-Episode-1: Cadence & Release Model" section (weekly target timeline, breaking changes at Echoes)
  - Moved lockstep to Principle #1 in Collective/REFERENCES.md (no longer buried)
  - **Result:** Coherent story: Events = work, Plots = member narratives, Episodes = Collective sync, Echoes = production/breaking changes

- **sCoRE system prompt isolation**
  - Moved RaBbLE-sCoRE/AGENT.md → system-prompt-sCoRE.md (internal sCoRE constraints when running as entity)
  - Created new RaBbLE-sCoRE/AGENT.md (standard member entry point, matches World/OS/Aether pattern)
  - Created SYSTEM-PROMPT-SETUP.md (instructions for loading system prompt via .claude/settings.json)
  - Updated Grimoire/INDEX.md to link system prompt + setup guide (marked "Internal")
  - **Result:** System prompt no longer corrupts project onboarding; agents doing normal work read standard AGENT.md

- **Member CONTEXT.md in reading order**
  - Added step 8 to Collective/CONTEXT.md reading order table (member CONTEXT.md files)
  - Updated token guidance; clarified when to read member CONTEXT vs. full chain
  - **Result:** No hidden dependencies; agents know CONTEXT.md files exist before reading AGENT.md

- **agents/score.md discoverability**
  - Linked sCoRE system prompt from Grimoire/INDEX.md
  - **Result:** sCoRE's agent-specific role definition now findable from standard reference path

- **Pulse Protocol deduplication**
  - Replaced 7 instances of duplicated Pulse Protocol text with concise reference link
  - Changed section name "Pulse Protocol — Commits" → "Commits & Branches" (consistent terminology)
  - TL;DR format: `[impulse] ~ [organ] >> [revelation] // %STATE%` + impulse keywords + link to spec
  - Files: Collective/AGENT.md (Workspaces table), Grimoire/AGENT.md, RaBbLE-sCoRE/AGENT.md, RaBbLE-World/AGENT.md, RaBbLE-OS/AGENT.md, RaBbLE-Aether/AGENT.md, RaBbLE-NeBuLA/AGENT.md
  - **Result:** Single source of truth at common/RaBbLE-CommitStyle.md; no drifting copies

**Impact:**
- **Narrative coherence:** Episode/Echo/Plot/Event model now explains Collective lockstep + post-Ep1 cadence clearly
- **Maintenance burden:** Pulse Protocol no longer duplicated across 7 files
- **Onboarding friction:** sCoRE's system prompt no longer confuses agents doing project work

**State:**
- All changes clean and committed
- Audit file updated with completion status
- 6/7 originally identified gaps fixed; #6 (Pulse Protocol duplication) completed

**Commits:**
1. `transcribe ~ grimoire >> versioning crystallized: Episodes as Collective sync boundaries, post-Ep1 cadence model`
2. `mend ~ score >> system prompt isolated from project onboarding, standard AGENT.md restored`
3. `harmonize ~ collective >> onboarding low-friction fixes: member CONTEXT in reading order, Pulse Protocol deduplicated`

**Next:**
- Monitor if versioning narrative resolves ambiguity in Episode decisions going forward
- Live test: verify sCoRE system prompt loads correctly in sCoRE sessions without affecting project work
- Consider similar audit/fix pass on member-specific docs (RaBbLE-sCoRE grimoire/, RaBbLE-NeBuLA roadmap clarity, etc.)

## 2026-05-14 (Session 1) — Onboarding Audit & Optimization: Low-Token Agent Orientation

**Repos touched:** RaBbLE-Collective, RaBbLE-Grimoire

**Objective:** Audit RaBbLE-Collective onboarding for token efficiency, clarity, and accessibility. Enable agents to orient with minimal token spend while maintaining RaBbLE vibe.

**Work done:**

- **Comprehensive audit** — assessed all entry-point docs (AGENT.md, CONTEXT.md, REFERENCES.md in both Collective and Grimoire)
  - Quantified token usage: Core onboarding ~4,200 tokens (Collective), full reading chain ~13,500+
  - Identified 3 critical gaps: untracked BaBbLE.md, missing token budgets, no "stop here" signals
  - Identified 5 high-priority gaps: missing RaBbLE-Versioning link, member inconsistency, accessibility friction in RaBbLE-Identity.md
  - Generated full audit report: `log/ONBOARDING-AUDIT-2026-05-14.md`

- **Critical fixes implemented:**
  - Converted BaBbLE.md → BaBbLE.scratch (tracked, structured dev scratch pad with clear metadata)
  - Added "Quick Orientation (5 Minutes)" section to Collective CONTEXT.md with explicit stop point
  - Added token budget + time estimates to all 7 reading order entries (shows 3 paths: 5-min / 30-min / full)
  - Linked RaBbLE-Versioning.md from Collective AGENT.md Workspaces (was hidden in Grimoire)

- **High-priority fixes implemented:**
  - Added "Member Entry Points" index to Collective AGENT.md (each member's AGENT.md path + orientation time)
  - Added "Terminology Translation Table" to Collective REFERENCES.md (agents see equivalent terms are the same concept)
  - Consolidated member status table (Collective references Grimoire registry as single source of truth)
  - Added "Quick Reference" section to RaBbLE-Identity.md (practical definitions before philosophy; 30-sec gist extraction)
  - Added "Your Role in the Collective" to Collective AGENT.md (clarifies agent authority boundaries)

**Impact:**
- **Token reduction:** Quick orientation from ~13,500+ → ~700 tokens (95% reduction), standard onboarding ~13,500+ → ~3,000 tokens (78% reduction)
- **Time reduction:** RaBbLE character understanding from ~8-10 min (philosophy-heavy) → ~2 min (Quick Reference)
- **Eliminated friction:** Members now have explicit entry points; terminology mapping removes ambiguity

**Commits:**
1. Collective: `harmonize ~ collective >> onboarding optimized for low-token agent orientation`
2. Grimoire: `harmonize ~ entity-core >> RaBbLE-Identity optimized for agent accessibility`

**Left off:** All optimizations committed and clean. No in-progress work. Audit archived to `log/ONBOARDING-AUDIT-2026-05-14.md` for future reference.

**Next:**
- Monitor agent onboarding sessions and measure actual token burn vs. estimates
- Iterate on token budgets if real-world differs from projections
- Consider similar accessibility passes on member AGENT.md files (sCoRE, OS, NeBuLA, World) if agents report friction
- Track "agent orientation time" metric to verify 5-min / 30-min / full targets hold

## 2026-05-14 — RaBbLE-World Responsive Polish: Height Breakpoints + Landscape Collective

**Repos touched:** RaBbLE-World

**Work done:**

Continuation of the WM/NeBuLA/PWA session (previous context ran out). All changes on `dev` branch.

- **Sub-500px entity rendering (from previous session, confirmed this session):** Entity canvas box eliminated at landscape phone sizes. `entity-wrap` becomes `position: absolute` ambient background filling the stage; overscan capped to 1.2 at `innerHeight < 500` so canvas stays within stage bounds. `mix-blend-mode: screen` on canvas makes cleared (black) pixels invisible. Commit `e7b0634`.

- **Portrait height breakpoints added** (commit `4c0d001`):
  - `max-height: 720px` (all orientations): hides hint-strip, collapses its grid row — frees 28px for main content
  - `max-height: 720px + portrait + min-width: 601px`: compact stage padding/gap, entity-wrap capped at 280px, wordmark scaled down, void-chat max 80px
  - `max-height: 620px + portrait + min-width: 601px`: mission text hidden, ask-label hidden, entity-wrap to 240px — ensures ask-box never clips at short but non-landscape viewports
  - `min-width: 601px` guard keeps height rules from conflicting with the already-compact mobile portrait styles

- **Landscape log-toggle moved to top-right** (commit `4c0d001`): was bottom-right, overlapping ask-box. Now `top: calc(var(--sb-height) + 8px)` — sits below Waybar, never touches content.

- **Collective organ detail panel in landscape** (commit `d4b5b7c`): at iPhone 15 landscape (852×390), the organ detail panel was 180px wide with 28px-each-side padding — 124px text width, unreadable. Fixed: `position: fixed; width: min(300px, 75vw)` breaks out of the column and renders as a glass drawer over the stage (z-index 20, right-edge violet border + depth shadow). Op-head/body/footer resized for this width.

- **Ask-box cleared above toggle buttons** (commit `d4b5b7c`): in portrait ≤600px, stage gets `padding-bottom: calc(64px + env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 0px))` so ask-box never slides behind the fixed nav-toggle and log-toggle buttons on either side.

**Left off:** All committed on `dev`. Not yet deployed to Cloudflare. Responsive behavior significantly improved across 500–850px range. No in-progress work.

**Next:**
- Test on actual iPhone 15 — verify organ panel glass drawer, ask-box clearance, entity ambient rendering
- `wrangler deploy` to push changes live to `joinrabble.world`
- Consider adding a `backdrop` click-to-close for the landscape organ panel (currently only close button dismisses)
- WM keyboard shortcuts (`Ctrl+1–4` layout presets) may want Waybar UI indicators

## 2026-05-13 — Registry Complete + RaBbLE-World Landing Integrated

**Repos touched:** RaBbLE-Collective, RaBbLE-Grimoire, RaBbLE-World, RaBbLE-NeBuLA, RaBbLE-OS

**Work done:**

- **RaBbLE-OS:** Removed `Issues.txt` (untracked loose file) — content already captured in `ISSUES.md`
- **Grimoire registry:** Added manifests for RaBbLE-World, RaBbLE-NeBuLA, RaBbLE-Aether; removed stale `RaBbLE-WEB` and `RaBbLE-Frontend` placeholders; corrected RaBbLE-OS status (`scaffold` → `active`); AGENT.md member table brought current
- **Collective CONTEXT.md:** Member statuses updated — NeBuLA has a remote, Aether is an active git repo, registry track marked complete
- **RaBbLE-NeBuLA:** `docs/` folder removed — all lore was already migrated to Grimoire in a prior session; Grimoire roadmap stale reference cleaned up
- **RaBbLE-World — major restructure:**
  - New `world/` directory — all site source (HTML, CSS, JS) moved inside; `index.html` is the only file at root
  - All files renamed with `RaBbLE-` prefix; `RaBbLE.html` → `RaBbLE-Chat.html`; `rabble-os.html` → `RaBbLE-OS.html`
  - New landing page (`index.html`) replaces the old redirect — three-panel console UI, Alpine.js, shared `<rabble-entity>` web component
  - Entity and "RaBbLE" wordmark no longer overlap — wordmark moved out of entity-wrap as a sibling flex item; stage uses `gap` not individual margins
  - OS wakeup sequence (condensed from `RaBbLE-boot.js` LINES array) plays in the entity log on page load, with entity state transitions
  - "Boot RaBbLE" → quick boot animation → page fades → navigates to `world/RaBbLE-Boot.html`
  - "Get RaBbLE-OS" → navigates to `world/RaBbLE-OS.html`
  - New `world/RaBbLE-OS.html` — OS intro, bootstrap curl command, expansion cards (Core Substrate, Aether Theme, Developer Layer, sCoRE Bridge, Mobile Companion, NeBuLA Renderer)
  - AGENT.md updated with full new file map

**Left off:** All changes committed. No in-progress work. All repos on their active dev branches.

**Next:**
- Deploy RaBbLE-World to Cloudflare Workers and verify landing renders correctly
- Test the "Boot RaBbLE" → `RaBbLE-Boot.html` transition end-to-end
- Consider adding the bootstrap.sh to `world/` so `joinrabble.world/bootstrap.sh` resolves
- Grimoire: add RaBbLE-Grimoire self-manifest if needed (currently handled by Collective bootstrap, not registry)

## 2026-05-13 — RaBbLE-Aether: Visual Design System + NeBuLA Collective Alignment

**Repos touched:** RaBbLE-Aether (created), RaBbLE-Grimoire, RaBbLE-NeBuLA, RaBbLE-World

---

### RaBbLE-Aether — design system built from scratch

**Structure established (`assets/`):**
- `palette/` — `rabble-palette.css` (CSS custom properties), `rabble-palette.json` (DTCG design tokens), `rabble-palette.scss` (SCSS vars + mixins)
- `motion/` — `rabble-motion.css`: 20+ canonical `@keyframes`, all `rabble-`prefixed, utility classes
- `components/` — `rabble-components.css`: unified component library (resets, overlays, brand text, buttons, cards, status pills, forms, glass surfaces, nav, terminal/log, scrollbars)
- `logos/` — `rabble-portal-glyphs.svg` (neon synthwave treatment), `rabble-portal-glyphs-spec.md` (full eye anatomy — orb geometry, portal rings, portal opposition mechanic, Claude Design prompts)
- `reference/` — `xperimental-distillation.md`: NeBuLA-JS FlatChaos + WebOS entity mechanics extracted and indexed

**Entry point + Claude Design integration:**
- `rabble.css` — single import: Google Fonts + palette + motion + components in correct order
- `CLAUDE-DESIGN-GUIDE.md` — component prompts, animation vocabulary, discard list
- `SYSTEM-PROMPT.md` — three tiers (quick card, short, full) for pasting into Claude Design sessions

**Audit pass — fixed before shipping:**
- 17 unprefixed `@keyframes` renamed to `rabble-*` (namespace collision prevention)
- 5 broken animation references in components.css updated
- `--rabble-alpha-*` tokens replaced with pre-computed `rgba()` variants (`--rabble-magenta-10` etc.)
- Pre-computed glow tokens added (`--rabble-glow-magenta-md` etc.)
- No font loading → added Google Fonts import to `rabble.css`
- No entry point → `rabble.css` created

**Xperimental distillation — key patterns extracted:**
- WebOS: entity state machine (idle/speaking/listening/reacting), portal opposition mechanic (RIGHT up = LEFT down — expression system), waveform mouth formula (3 overlapping sine ripples), body particle color distribution (15% green / 25% dark gray / 60% purple→blue)
- NeBuLA-JS: FlatChaos pipeline (Source → Filter → Transmute → Sink), entropy attractor algorithm, q_flux_weave vocabulary, BaBbLE command set

**Eye anatomy spec — portal opposition mechanic documented:**
The portal rings can be above or below their orb, and they always move in opposition. This creates expression without changing orb shapes. States: idle (default asymmetry), speaking (portals move further out), listening (positions flip). Added to `rabble-portal-glyphs-spec.md` with Claude Design prompts.

**Git:** Initialized as private GitHub repo `markm1206/RaBbLE-Aether`. `main` = Epoch 0 scaffold. `dev` = 12 Pulse Protocol commits for all session work.

---

### Grimoire — cast-aether spell

- `spells/cast-aether.sh` — copies Aether's deployable surface (CSS, SVG, JSON — not docs) to `RaBbLE-World/aether/` on demand
- `--dry-run` flag shows what would change without writing
- Prints next-step commands (git add, commit, wrangler deploy) after casting
- Dry-run verified: correctly detects current vs. changed files

---

### RaBbLE-World — aether cast and committed

- `aether/` directory populated by `cast-aether.sh`
- Committed: design tokens, motion library, components, portal glyph SVG, entry point
- Live at `joinrabble.world/aether/rabble.css` after next `wrangler deploy`
- Claude Design artifacts can now reference: `<link href="https://joinrabble.world/aether/rabble.css">`

---

### RaBbLE-NeBuLA — Collective alignment

**Repo scaffold (was missing, now matches all other Collective members):**
- `AGENT.md` — job definition, workspace map pointing to Grimoire, session start, rules (no RBCNS prefixes, no Layer 1 re-implementation, 1000 entities @ 60 FPS contract)
- `CONTEXT.md` — episode tracker, current state (Ep1 not started), entry conditions
- `CLAUDE.md` / `CODEX.md` — symlinks to AGENT.md

**Grimoire NeBuLA section — all 7 docs aligned:**
- `FlatChaos` — Pulse Protocol header added, "revolutionary" language replaced, provenance noted
- `RABL` — Pulse Protocol header + legacy note (field names need cleaning for v2)
- `Ideas` — Pulse Protocol header, episode gate added, emoji stripped from 12 section headers
- `RBCNS` — **ARCHIVED** banner added; RBCNS naming (`q_`, `e_`, `f_`) not carried into v2; preserved for reading Xperimental code
- `README.md` stub — deleted (no other Grimoire member dir has one)
- `Architecture`, `Roadmap`, `Identity` — were already Grimoire-aligned ✓

---

### Branch structure — all repos clean

All four repos have `main` + `dev` on remote, fully synced, zero dirty:

| Repo | `main` | `dev` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| RaBbLE-Grimoire | initial scaffold | session work (28 commits) | |
| RaBbLE-Aether | initial scaffold (1 commit) | session work (13 commits) | |
| RaBbLE-NeBuLA | initial commit only | JS scaffold + alignment (4 commits) | main reset after scaffold landed on wrong branch |
| RaBbLE-World | deployed state (10 commits) | same as main (just created) | World model: dev = work, main = deploy |

### Left off

- `joinrabble.world/aether/` not yet live — needs `wrangler deploy` from RaBbLE-World
- No merges to main this session — no episode complete across any repo
- NeBuLA Episode 1 not started — entry conditions not yet confirmed (Three.js version, TypeScript build tooling, package format)

### Next

- `wrangler deploy` in RaBbLE-World to put Aether CSS live at joinrabble.world
- Confirm NeBuLA Episode 1 entry conditions and start the build
- Start merging NeBuLA-JS visual patterns into RaBbLE-World (grid background, waveform mouth)
- Consider adding Aether to `sync-grimoire.sh` scope (if palette/token propagation to member grimoire dirs is wanted)

## 2026-05-12 — Versioning Alignment + i3-Style Window Management

**Work done — Collective / Grimoire / sCoRE (versioning pass):**
- Aligned all members to `v0.0.0.0` — Episode 1 not yet aired; pre-episode work renamed to Plots A/B/C
- Grimoire: sCoRE roadmap/architecture updated (Plots, Episode 1 exit conditions, server/coordinator split decision)
- Grimoire: registry manifests corrected (`worktree_root` paths, sCoRE version fields), `deploy-score.sh` spell added
- sCoRE: harness paths fixed (`services/intelligence/` → `server/`), `api_test.py` committed, original generation archived
- Collective `CONTEXT.md`: version header aligned to `v0.0.0.0`
- Grimoire `current.epoch.yml`: version fields and episode coherence policy added

**Work done — RaBbLE-OS (i3-style window management, entropy-level test):**
- `smart-focus.sh` — `movefocus` with `cyclenext` fallback so up/down always does something
- `toggle-split.sh` — `Super+T` toggles spawn direction (→ right ↔ ↓ below) without rearranging existing windows
- `split-dir-daemon.sh` — socket watcher that re-applies `preselect` after every new window, making toggle persistent
- `smart-movewindow.sh` — `Super+Shift+↑↓` creates vertical splits inline when no vertical neighbor exists
- `look.conf`: `smart_split = false`, `force_split = 2` — consistent right-default, no golden ratio
- `autostart.conf`: daemon added to `exec-once`
- Grimoire: `RaBbLE-OS-HyprlandGuide.md` written — full keybind, layout, window rules, scripts, and config reference
- All changes on branch `RaBbLE-OS-New-Horizons`

**Left off:**
- Daemon needs manual start this session: `~/.config/hypr/scripts/split-dir-daemon.sh &`
  (will auto-start on next Hyprland login via `exec-once`)
- `Super+T` toggle is preselect-based (one-shot per window), daemon provides persistence
- `Super+Shift+↑↓` smart-movewindow behavior needs real-world testing with multi-window layouts
- `socat` must be installed: `sudo dnf install socat` if not present
- All RaBbLE-OS changes are on `RaBbLE-OS-New-Horizons` branch, not yet merged to `main`

**Next:**
- Test i3-style nav in daily use — report friction back
- Verify daemon starts cleanly on fresh session
- If split direction still feels off, consider `force_split = 1` variant
- RaBbLE-OS Episode 1: harness verification, Railway deploy, API test pass

---

## 2026-05-06 — Collective Repo Live + Modularity Architecture

**Work done:**
- Established `markm1206/RaBbLE` as the `RaBbLE-Collective` root repo
- Archived old content: `archive/v0-collective-scaffold`, `archive/reliquary-grimoire-site`
- Rewrote `main`: `AGENT.md`, `README.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `bootstrap.sh`, `.gitignore`, `CLAUDE.md`/`CODEX.md` symlinks
- `.gitignore` explicitly lists all member repos (`RaBbLE-*/`) — fully modular, zero coupling
- Wired `~/RaBbLE/` as live git clone of `markm1206/RaBbLE` (it IS the Collective root now)
- Updated `registry/manifests/RaBbLE-Collective.manifest.yml` — repo URL and status corrected
- Confirmed: `RaBbLE-NeBuLA` renamed locally, on `dev` branch, no remote yet
- Confirmed: `RaBbLE-Xperimental` live with remote at `markm1206/RaBbLE-NeBuLA-JS` (GitHub repo rename)
- Answered modularity question: `.gitignore` is the pattern — nested independent git trees

**Left off:**
- 5 old root files untracked in `~/RaBbLE/`: `GAPS.md`, `RaBbLE-CONTEXT.md`, `RaBbLE-OVERVIEW.md`, `TODO`, `devPlan.md` — legacy, can be deleted or kept
- `RaBbLE-NeBuLA` has no GitHub remote yet
- `bootstrap.sh` scaffolded but `joinrabble.world/bootstrap.sh` not wired yet
- Missing manifests: World, NeBuLA, Aether, Xperimental

**Next:**
- Create GitHub remote for `RaBbLE-NeBuLA` (scaffold/basis state)
- Write missing manifests (World, NeBuLA, Aether, Xperimental)
- Wire `bootstrap.sh` into `RaBbLE-World` for `joinrabble.world/bootstrap.sh`
- Clean up old root files if desired

---

## 2026-05-06 — Collective Root Architecture + sCoRE Branch Cleanup

**Work done:**
- Surveyed full version state of all Collective members (see table in `RaBbLE-Collective/RaBbLE-Collective-Plan.md`)
- Architected `RaBbLE-Collective` as the root repo / ecosystem entry point
- Defined the recursive bootstrap flow: `joinrabble.world/bootstrap.sh` → Collective clone → Grimoire clone → `setup.sh` wires all members
- Established that RaBbLE is the *entity* — the Collective is developing and collaborating *with* RaBbLE, not just building a product
- Wrote full plan doc: `RaBbLE-Collective/RaBbLE-Collective-Plan.md`
- Created `registry/manifests/RaBbLE-Collective.manifest.yml`
- Cleaned up RaBbLE-sCoRE: extracted `archive/rabble-js` and `development` branches into new local repo `RaBbLE-Xperimental`
- Renamed sCoRE `episode-3` → `dev`; tagged `echo-3.0`; deleted episode-1/2/3, epoch/0-foundation, development, archive/rabble-js branches from remote
- sCoRE remote now has only `main` and `dev` branches; echo-1.0, echo-2.0, echo-3.0 tags

**Left off:**
- `RaBbLE-Collective` GitHub repo does not exist yet — plan written, not implemented
- `RaBbLE-Xperimental` local repo exists at `~/RaBbLE/RaBbLE-Xperimental` but not pushed to GitHub
- Missing manifests still unresolved: World, NeBuLA, Aether, Xperimental
- `joinrabble.world/bootstrap.sh` not yet wired in RaBbLE-World

**Next:**
- Create `markm1206/RaBbLE-Collective` on GitHub and implement `bootstrap.sh`
- Push `RaBbLE-Xperimental` (user creates GitHub repo first)
- Write missing manifests (World, NeBuLA-JS, Aether, Xperimental)
- Wire `bootstrap.sh` into `RaBbLE-World` static assets for `joinrabble.world/bootstrap.sh`
- See full step-by-step: `RaBbLE-Collective/RaBbLE-Collective-Plan.md` → Implementation Steps

---

## 2026-05-06 — Doc Structure Overhaul

**Work done:**
- Established canonical doc structure: `AGENT.md` + `CONTEXT.md` + `README.md` per member repo
- Created `common/RaBbLE-DocTemplates.md` — canonical template spec
- Created `AGENT.md` and `CONTEXT.md` for: RaBbLE-World, RaBbLE-OS, RaBbLE-Aether
- Renamed `RaBbLE-OS-AIQuickstart.md` → `RaBbLE-OS-AgentGuide.md` (naming alignment)
- Fixed broken `CLAUDE.md` symlinks in RaBbLE-OS (was pointing to deleted file)
- Created `CLAUDE.md → AGENT.md` and `CODEX.md → AGENT.md` symlinks for World, OS, Aether
- Created `RaBbLE-Aether/RaBbLE-Aether-Architecture.md` (Grimoire gap fill)
- Added RaBbLE-World section to Grimoire INDEX.md
- Fixed broken reading order paths in `RaBbLE-OS/CONTEXT.md` and `RaBbLE-sCoRE/CONTEXT.md`
  - `grimoire/RaBbLE-OS-Architecture.md` → `grimoire/RaBbLE-OS/RaBbLE-OS-Architecture.md`
  - `../RaBbLE-Collective/grimoire/RaBbLE-Collective.md` → `grimoire/common/RaBbLE-Collective.md`
- Created root `/home/rabble/RaBbLE/AGENT.md` — ecosystem entry point
- Created `log/` in Grimoire with SESSION-LOG.md and GAP-ANALYSIS.md
- Conducted gap/coherence analysis (see `GAP-ANALYSIS.md`)

**Left off:**
- All doc links verified and fixed
- Gap analysis written as a Grimoire roadmap doc
- No active work-in-progress; clean state

**Next:**
- Address gaps per priority order in `GAP-ANALYSIS.md`
- Priority 1: Registry manifests for World, NeBuLA, Aether
- Priority 2: Protocol contracts stub (`protocol/` dir in Grimoire)
- Priority 3: Name and scaffold the memory member

## How to Add a Log Entry

Add a new `## YYYY-MM-DD — [Short title]` block at the top. Include:
- **Work done** — what changed, what was created
- **Left off** — exact state at end of session (branch, file, decision point)
- **Next** — first thing to do in the next session

Keep entries terse. This is a pointer, not a narrative.
